          <h4><td>Analog Algorhithms</td></h4>
        <p>
           Algorithms seemed like something abstract and far away to me, 
           although, of course, I know we are surrounded by them at all times. 
           When we were being told to create our own algorithm, meant to create a design pattern by just using word instructions. 
           Which we would then give to to others, that would follow them and create an image just by what you've wrote
           I was curious to find out, how I could make it work. Surprisingly it was very difficult to create just the right
           <td><strong>mixture between determination and coincidence,</strong></td> so that there was a certain degree of variation, 
           but still distinct features by which one could identify 
           the idea behind the design.
           <br><br>
           <td><strong>my first attempt on creating an algorithm:</strong></td>
           <blockquote>
            Draw a 10 × 10 cm square. Draw a line from the center of the top horizontal line of the square to 
            the center of the bottom line of the square. Draw the diagonal from the top center line to the bottom 
            left point. Draw a diagonal from the top line to the bottom right point.

            Draw a circle that touches all the inner centers of the square. 
           Paint the central rectangle black and draw a circle at each corner of the square 
            with the corner point of the square in the middle of the circle. 
            The circles should be so large that they border the outer line of the inner circle

           <figcaption><code>the first algorhithm was quite strict in it's rules, so I decided to change it up a bit </code></figcaption>
           <br><br>
            I tried quite a lot of different wordings until I was 
           satisfied with the outcome. At first there was very little variation, because I thought 
           the task was to word the instructions so precise, that the outcome would be excatly the image you had in mind. 
           I then understood, that leaving a little room for interpretation and chance, would actually add a lot to the design, 
           because it was a lot more interesting, to look at how different people would react to the little room you left for improvisation. 
           the final wording of my algorhithm was:
           <br><br>
           <td><strong>my second attempt on creating an algorithm:</strong></td>
           <blockquote> <td> 
            Draw with a black marker. Do not fill the sheet to the edge, but leave at least 4 cm space.
            Draw a circle about 3 cm in size. Draw a small circle in the center of the large circle. 
            Draw four ovals that evenly cross the large circle. Connect the four ovals with an even black curved line. 
            Draw a line from the outer end of each oval outwards. Connect some of the lines together. 
            Add more ovals and lines bordering the existing pattern to complete the pattern.</td>

          </blockquote> 
          Overall I found the thought behind this task really intriguing because it highlighted 
           how little variations of phrasing could have a huge difference in the outcome of something. 
           I Figured that this was not just the case in the digital realm, but also in real life. Little changed of words, 
           actions and thoughts, can have an immense impact on your reality.

           <br>
           Fabian told us a lot about the changes
            that would be expected in the field of art and in all aspects of life basically. 
            The way everything is and would possibly become fully digitalized. What made me quite sad was the realization 
            that this was the thruth, all things we know nowadays are being translated into algorhithms, equasions and numbers. 
            From a purely human perspective I wonder if reality is really that simple. If being human, the experience of being alive, of looking at the world 
            can be encaptured in these machines. We learned that generally computers only differenciate between 0 and 1. True or false. Right and wrong. 
            I wonder if that way to view the world, society, humans, is a good way to move forward. Or if potentially, we loose a lot of the beauty and magic of being 
            alive in these digital realms. but that is just a personal view of course. There is nothing you can do about it anyways.
             Withing the next weeks this thought process about my own opinion on the topic was very present.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Digital Algorhithms</h4>
        <p>Thematically following the first week, in week three we were supposed 
          to program our own “algorithm” using p5js. The aim was to create <td><strong>“small multiples”, </strong></td>
          i.e. small designs that had both some uniform components and differences that were created 
          randomly every time the page was reloaded. There should also be a certain degree of chance here, 
          but there should also be consistency. As inspiration for the design, 
          I chose the mandala-like design that I had already taken in the first week of creating the algorithm. 
          Since I found the two projects to at least partially build on each other thematically, I decided to look at them 
          together in my documentation. <br> <br>

          To build my code, I first started by importing type script files for p5js into Replit with the 
          setup in which I had a canvas size of 500x500. 
          The setup only runs once and determines components such as background color, 
          stroke color and size of the canvas. I then explained some global variables such as “area”, “number” 
          (to define the number of components), “gutter” (the distance between individual grid cells) 
          as well as width, height, X, Y (the original position of the design in the Grid) and “Diam” 
          (the extent of the individual elements in the grid) to define the size and layout of the grid. 
          I then created some nested loops that divide the canvas into a grid in which each small multiple should have a position. 
          In these loops I also created the individual shape and color components, which were to be generated randomly.
           The individual shapes each had a value in which the size was randomly generated within a given frame 
           (e.g. Random (50.90). I used circles, ellipses and lines for the design. <br> <br>
          
          Looking back, I can say that I was and am generally quite satisfied with the project, even if certain parts could definitely use some improvement. 
          Similary to the project at the beginning of the semester, it would have been interesting to make even more coincidence possible. 
          The individual shapes could also not be adapted to a changed diameter, as the construction would then collapse. 
          I also wondered why there were a bunch of lines in the corner of my design. 
          Nevertheless, the project gave me a better view of the opportunities that arise from working with algorithms, but from a philosophical perspective also the human desire for control and social norms</p>

        <h4>Project Morning Box </h4>
        <p>
          After working with hardware for the first time the previous week (keyboard hack), 
          we were now supposed to build and present a prototype that had both software and hardware components. 
          Fabian divided the teams. I worked with Leonie and we initially brainstormed a bit about 
          the ideas we had; We quickly agreed that we would both find a little everyday helper quite interesting. 
          The idea was to develop a tool that would make the otherwise often stressful and disorganized
           morning a little more cheerful and structured.
          <br>
          <br>
          To do this,we decided that there should be a small tool placed in the bathroom that sets a timer 
          when you close the bathroom door to give each person a certain amount of time in the bathroom.
          So that everyone has their set timespot where they can take tehir time to get ready, while also 
          taking care, that the other have enough time to get ready. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="photos/MorningBox3.png" alt="Image Description" style="width: 800px;">
          <br>
          <br>
          A morning playlist should also be played when entering the bathroom, 
          which will try to lift your mood in the morning. In order to ensure that these functions could be 
          implemented at all, we first looked at the existing software “Keyboard Maestro” and ways to 
          trigger a signal when the door was closed. We also decided that the everyday helper should be very 
          compact and easy to use. We decided to trigger the signal using a circuit that is closed when the door 
          is closed. This is in turn connected to a specific letter key on the keyboard chip that we had from 
          the previous week. Triggering this key then triggers a signal in the computer's Keyboard Maestro software, 
          making the eventual function possible.

          <code>photo from our PowerPoint, explaining the way the Box is supposed to work</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          When implementing it, our first problem was soldering, as none of us had any real experience with it. 
          It took us a long time to connect the two cables to the keyboard.
          When this was the case, we connected the keyboard to my laptop and checked the function of the key 
          by holding the two cables together to close the circuit. After some time it worked and the "8" 
          key was triggered by connecting the two cables on my computer. 
          The next problem was finding the right features in Keyboard Maestro. 
          There was no real timer function, just a “pause” function that limited the time 
          in certain applications. We experimented a lot, tried to program the whole thing, 
          and ultimately decided to work around the problem by combining two of our functions. 
          Closing the circuit triggered the pause function and the opening of the playlist, 
          which meant that this playlist was only played for a certain time, 
          after which a signal tone was heard. We tested the function often and everything seemed to work, 
          although there were a few times when the duration of the playlist played either a little shorter 
          or a little longer than intended by the pause function.
          <br>
          <br>
          We also started building the prototype, in the form of a small box, 
          with a door that would represent the bathroom door, to which an aluminum foil was attached. 
          Inside were the cables that connected to the keyboard chip and thus the compute. They touched the aluminum 
          foil on the inside when the door was closed. We discussed that Leonie would work a little further on making the prototype look appealing and 
          I would prepare the PowerPoint presentation. Since we were a bit skeptical as to whether the project 
          would actually work when presented, we shot a video to prove it just to be on the safe side. And lucklily we did, 
          because of course 
         the prototype did in fact not work on the day of the presentation.
         <br>
         <br>
        who would have expected otherwise.
        <br><br>
        All in all, the project inspired me to think in terms of product design and tools, as there are completely new and exciting possibilities. 
        On the other hand, I also found the part with soldering and electronics very annoying, as I don't really have an interest to learn about it. 
        I found the idea behind the product, as well as creating a storyline etc., to be far more interesting.

        <h4>The sleeping uncle project</h4>
        <p>
          Before the lecture free period began, we started with a larger group project. 
          At first I thought it was great that we had the opportunity to individually 
          set a focus that then interested us more. I was on the documentation team with Bleona and Isabella, 
          which I personally found very exciting because, on the one hand, I would like to learn to film and 
          work with video editing programs, and on the other hand, I also found building websites very exciting. </p>
          <img src="photos/TeamDoku.png" alt="Image Description" style="width: 800px;align-items: center;">
        <code>some photos we took the first week</code>
        <br><br>
        In the first week we set general 
        to-dos and divided the tasks among ourselves. 
        We created joint mood boards and I designed a PowerPoint presentation 
        in which we presented them and addressed some open questions and problems. 
        Documenting the process has been a bit of a casual thing since week one. 
        At the weekend I sat down directly at the website and spent a total of at least
         5 hours working on a very small-step website tutorial, which meant that 
         at the beginning of the next week I already had the basis of a finished website that 
         theoretically just needed to be personalized.
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="photos/Doku3.png" alt="Image Description" style="width: 800px;align-items: center;">

         <br><br>
         Sadly, Fabian rejected this and we should start from 0. At first I was very disappointed 
         and frustrated because the tutorial cost me a lot of nerves, but in the end I'm very happy 
         because it gave us good tools for building a website that we could also use for semester submissions. 
         After we first roughly sketched out the structure of the website as we imagined it, 
         I first started designing the header. 
         The link to “pico.css” made this much easier because there was already a basic framework. 
         I divided the individual sections into h1, h2, h3 etc. as well as individual groups (e.g. “hgroup”), 
         inserted the logo and then determined the style in a single tag. In the “nav bar” 
         I added some general information about us. I also added an illustration as a background image. 
         We also use individual elements from the “pico.css” example, such as the accordions. 
         All of this helped us a lot to design the look of the site in a very simple, very beautiful way.
         <br><br>

         <code>an overview of the current state of the website</code>
         <br><br>
         Over the next few weeks we added the individual texts and images into our basic framework. 
         What I found very difficult was getting the website to adapt to the window size. 
         Sometimes you had to experiment a lot or discuss things with Chat GPT before you could 
         finally find a solution. We also didn't get along well with building the repository 
         because we couldn't push and push each other's changes. So we simply designed most of it on my 
         computer without having to constantly send it back and forth to each other. Last week we finished 
         building the website. I tried to do something with Premiere Pro, and also found Premiere Rush to 
         be a good and much lighter alternative to Premiere Pro. We created a storyboard where we 
         summarized which scenes we had to film and how.
         <br><br>
         What really stressed me out was filming and editing the product video, 
         as I would have liked to have filmed it before the start of the lecture-free period,
          but in the end it didn't work out well because the project wasn't finished at that point. 
          Likewise, the prototype simply didn't look particularly nice, apart from the animation, 
          which looked really great. So we tried to fake the whole thing, but it still just didn't 
          look good. Nevertheless, we filmed all the scenes that we wanted to have in the video. 
          Bleona, Isabella, Mirea and I helped Arne buy the materials, lay the carpet, and tried to 
          improve the look of the prototype a little by adding small illustrations. 
          We were all a little frustrated that the project wasn't finished yet. 
          I have to say that communication and work with each other worked very 
          well within our group, everyone had their tasks and always communicated the 
          latest status to the others. It was very difficult within the class.
          <br><br>
          It definitely has been a challenge to complete a project with a group this big. 
          But i really do feel like it has a lot of advantages and learnings to 
          do group projects. Though it can be super frustrating; You learn how to take responsability, 
          how to communicate and make decisions together rather than by yourself. 
          You learn how to find compromises and how to express criticism and how to pitch and present 
          your ideas to a group of people. 
          All of these seem like really important learnings also in regard to our future careers. 
          Also, I liked the way it was not just about coding but that for instance our group
          could also learn about video editing etc. I would be looking forward to doing more projects 
          like this in the future.
